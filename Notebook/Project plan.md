# Real-Time Threat Detection for Cybersecurity Logs

## Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Streaming

### 1. Set Up Development Environment

- **Goal:** Prepare your local machine or cloud environment for development.
- **Tools Required:**
  - Apache Kafka: For handling real-time log data streams.
  - Apache Spark: For processing the log data.
  - Docker: To facilitate containerization and deployment.
- **Tasks:** Install these tools following their official documentation and verify that they work correctly.

### 2. Create a Sample Log Producer

- **Goal:** Simulate generating security logs for testing.
- **Tasks:** Write a Python script that generates logs in a specific format (e.g., JSON). This script should produce different log events at random intervals, simulating real-world traffic.

### 3. Set Up Kafka and Create Topics

- **Goal:** Organize your log data into manageable streams.
- **Tasks:** Use Kafka's command-line tools to create a topic named `security_logs`. This topic will be where all security log messages are sent.

### 4. Implement Kafka Producer

- **Goal:** Send logs to the Kafka topic for real-time processing.
- **Tasks:** Modify your log producer script to include Kafka producer functionality. Use Kafkaâ€™s client libraries to send log data to the `security_logs` topic.

### 5. Set Up Spark Streaming to Consume Kafka Logs

- **Goal:** Read and process log data in real time.
- **Tasks:** Write a Spark application that reads from the Kafka topic. This application will transform and analyze incoming logs as they are produced.

## Phase 2: Anomaly Detection & Storage

### 6. Implement Anomaly Detection Logic

- **Goal:** Identify unusual patterns in the log data that may indicate security threats.
- **Tasks:** Use statistical methods or machine learning models to define and implement anomaly detection. For example, flag IP addresses that have too many failed login attempts within a specific time window.

### 7. Store Processed Data

- **Goal:** Persist processed logs for further analysis and reporting.
- **Tasks:** Choose a database (Hive for Big Data or PostgreSQL for structured data) and set up a schema to store the relevant fields (timestamp, IP, event type, severity, etc.). Store the anomaly detection results as well.

## Phase 3: Dashboard & Deployment

### 8. Build Visual Dashboard with Tableau/Grafana

- **Goal:** Create a user-friendly interface for monitoring security events.
- **Tasks:** Connect your database to Tableau or Grafana and create visualizations such as graphs of failed logins over time, alerts for anomalies, and geographical distribution of IP addresses.

### 9. Deploy Your Application

- **Goal:** Make your application accessible for real-world use.
- **Tasks:** Use Docker to containerize your Kafka and Spark applications. Deploy the containers on a cloud platform like AWS (using EC2 or ECS) or GCP. Ensure that your dashboard is also accessible and running smoothly in the cloud.
